What *is* BURST?
===

After a certain point rolling tons of dice is more cumbersome than fun. A way to prune fistfuls of dice while maintaining tangible power growth is by banking BURST points.

Banked BURST is assumed to be a success (+ or - depending on the attribute in reference) *before* a roll is made. For example, if the player has 10 BURST:POW against a Challenge:POW 7 obstacle, they pass the test without having to roll. If the player has a 10 BURST:POW against a Challenge:POW 13, they only need 3 successes. But this does *not* cross attribute lines. For example, 10 BURST:POW does not contribute to a Challenge:SPD 5.

Powerful techniques are fueled by BURST points. Some techniques require a set amount of points while others scale in power based on the points the player chooses to spend on it. Because the player is giving up a persistent bonus in exchange for a burst of power, but BURST points can be easily recovered through a variety of means so don't be shy about spending them in difficult encounters.
