The purpose of scaling values is to feel dramatic shifts in power gain over time.

I want to tactically feel powerful instead of just having big numbers and fancy equipment.

An experienced character should be physically changed with injuries and enhancements. They should have well developed abilities and several multi-stat techniques. Their character sheet tells a story.

BURST serves as the equivalent to a "level" and a way to gauge progression & power level

The pace is intended to be fast with big numbers and easy calculations. The action should hit hard with push-your-luck options.

Extra values should be kept to a minimum. There should be enough to keep it crunchy but not so much to bloat complexity.

The player should keep track of enhancements/injuries, People/Places/Things, and skills/techniques for the sake of role playing.  The only things that are not directly connected to roleplaying is the stats/Burst. Ideally, there are minimal abstract elements.

There should be an injury table to add variety to the many injuries characters will face. This includes poisons, bio-enhancements, cybernetics, magic enchantments, etc.

Some actions have conditions to meet (including but not limited to chargeups and cool downs. These conditions sometimes add Burst or something)

Afterlife is for those who want it. There *are* mechanics for it but its purely optional

#

* KNO	B00 + r + Kno + (Skl)
* POW	(B+1)(r+Pow)
* END	r+End [for each B, remove one lowest die] [Add threshold to next attack roll]
* SPD	Roll a pool of dice. For success > 0: {Add the threshold of each successful die to the total.  Remove failed dice from pool. Reroll remaining dice.} [success is measured]
* ESP	guess opposing total within Esp threshold [for each success, remove one highest die] [add the total from the dice you remove to next attack]
