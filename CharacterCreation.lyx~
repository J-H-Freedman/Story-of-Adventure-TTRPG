\begin_layout Subsection
Starting Point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I recommend starting out by listing a core idea to build off of.
 I recommend starting with a profession and starting technique.
 If you have the talent, I would also recommend drawing your character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reason to Start
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is your character going on an adventure? Was there a tragic event? Do
 you have nowhere else do go? What is it that you seek?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Person(s) of Influence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this adventure, who do you hold dear to your heart? Who helped make
 you the person you are today? How do you remember them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Personal Treasure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the one thing you cherish more than anything? Why do you cherish
 it? What would you do if your enemy destroyed it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Initial Condition to Finish
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What would cause you to cease your journey? This is not a perminant decision-
 just a starting point to work off of as the adventuer develops.

Preface

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Buying Attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have 50 points to spend between your five stats.
 It is acceptable and expected to have stats of 0.
 No need to worry- that just means you are average in those areas.
 You will still make the neccessary rolls; you just won't get bonuses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
BURST
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an attribute hits 100, it immediately BURSTs.
 This does a few things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gain a perminant upgrade
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These upgrades are different based on which attribute has BURST.
 Please refer to the attribute in question within 2.1
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gain a technique tied to the Attribute
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Tying techniques to attributes is further explained in 2.3.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduce the attribute to 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the Attribute reduction, I recommend BURSTing whenever possible.
 However, I also recommend having backup Attributes to compensate for the
 initial shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rounds, Turns, and Actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of how events take place are usually unimportant but are still
 expected to occur frequently.
 Hierchy is occurs as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rounds
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These encapsulate 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 character's Turn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After every character has had their turn, a new Round begins
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Turns
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These encapsulate 
\emph on
the selected
\emph default
 character's Actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each character takes one Turn per Round
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Actions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These are when characters actually do things
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each character gets two actions per Turn
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The same Action cannot be repeated multiple times within a single Turn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Double-Action is when you spend both Actions on a single task
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Notation

\begin_layout Itemize
d100 refers to two ten-sided dice
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A one hundred sided die can be used but I recommend against it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 rolled to create a number with a range of 100.
\begin_inset Foot

Alternatively, this roll can be done digitally to choose a random number
 within range of 100.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph default
 the determined threhsold is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the endurance is being 
\emph on
spent
\emph default

 The desired effect occurs 
\emph on
until
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time your action would take multiple turns run an END.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a BURST, perminantly increase the 
\emph on
