Buying Attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have 50 attribute points (ap) to spend between your five stats.
 It is acceptable and expected to have stats of 0.
 No need to worry- that just means you are average in those areas.
 You will still make the necessary rolls; you just won't get bonuses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because you start with 50ap, your starting Health is 50 and your starting
 Energy is 100

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an attribute hits 100, it immediately BURSTs.
 This does a few things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gain a permanent upgrade based on the affected attribute
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These upgrades are different based on which attribute has BURST.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduce the attribute to 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the Attribute reduction, I recommend BURSTing whenever possible.
 However, I also recommend having backup Attributes to compensate for the
 initial shock.

Alternatively, this roll can be done digitally to choose a random number

Roll a 2d100 and add [POW] to each result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A POW may be utilized for most Double-Actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a BURST, permanently increase the POW multiplier by 1 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $2\rightarrow3$

Storing your endurance produces positive effects in later turns.
 You want to boost this number as high as you can as quickly as you can.

If the endurance is being

\emph default
 from the previous turn(s), roll a d100 and subtract [END].
 The desired effect occurs 
\emph on
until
\emph default
 the determined threshold is reached.
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Spending your endurance prevents undesirable effects from happening.
 You want to keep the spent number low for as long as possible.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time your action would take multiple turns, you may run an END.
 Depending on context, an END may either be a basic action or a double-action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a BURST, permanently increase the 
\emph on
turn 
\emph default
multiplier by 1.
 This means you roll an additional action for 
\emph on
storing
\emph default
 and skip an additional action for 
\emph on
spending.

 Roll again with +10 to the threshold.
 If you succeed again, add the total to the stack.
 Repeat the process until you reach the determined maximum successes (if
 applicable) or when you fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time your action encompasses multiple smaller actions, you may roll
 a SPD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a BURST, preminantly gain an additonal free reroll upon SPD failures.

Before an opposing roll, you may conduct ESP.
 If the roll is within the range of your predicted [ESP], you succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time your character attempts to predict or react to external stimuli,
 roll ESP.

an ability may refer to either a skill or technique

 (i.e.
 Skills and Techniques) modify an attriute in some way.
 This works by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $[XXX]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $([XXX]+[skill/technique])$
\end_inset

 in XXXs' formula.
 The easiest way to understand this is by looking at Skills...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Skills represent specific instances of getting a bonus to your KNO challenges.
 It affects the formula thusly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $d100+([KNO]+[Skill])$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if you have a [KNO] of 20 and a Knitting skill of 37; then a Knitting
 Knitting challenge, you will add your d100 roll to 57 to calculate the
 result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Skills are used to perform a variety of quick tasks and can flesh out your
 character's past, present, and future.
 Before using Techniques, make sure you understand Skills first.

 These are typically used in character vs character challenges but may be
 used in normal challenges as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simarly to

There may be situations in which your Skill or technique is a negative number.
 This acts the same as when it is a positive number but you subtract instead
 of add.
 You are, afterall, adding a negative number
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may seem like a free bonus, but I recommend the player and/or the GM
 put the character in awful situations to make the game interesting.
 When an awful ability is rolled, store 1 Cool token.

 To advance it, roll a d10
