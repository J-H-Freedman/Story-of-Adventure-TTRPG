+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+ Added new format macros:
\calloutline
\vsObstacle
\vsCharacter
\burstline
Descriptions of how they work are in the comments for 'doc_formats.tex'

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+ Rewrote section on actions to reflect removal of double actionsa and that all 
actions are single actions. Current actions are as follows:
	- Attribute Check
	- Attribute Charge
	- Execute Technique

Cooldown-based actions are in the pipeline, but will be added as we figure out 
how the preceeding changes will work.

+ In the Challenges section I separated the Determined Threshold and Damage
subsections into their own sections since they could potentially be part
of either challenge type.

* Started rewriting the attributes section. Knowledge changed slightly to 
represent that its main scaler is skills.
