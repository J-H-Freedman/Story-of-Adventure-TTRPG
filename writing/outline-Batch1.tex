\subsection*{Act IV: Conclude}
They leave the party with the other mutant.

\subsection*{Act III: Release Tension}
It's midnight. Angel asks their spotter if anyone evacuated. The spotter discloses that there's no heavy traffic. Angel expresses disgust and telepathically lifts the sword out of the ground. A mist of miasma spreads from the ground's wound; killing every animal, plant, and fungus within the scars' radius.
