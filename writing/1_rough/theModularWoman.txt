Another job, another face to put on. Audry has been bouncing between jobs for the past few years. Now approaching her mid 30s, she has collected more mods than she can keep track of. they're like textbooks: sometimes you find it cheaper to buy a used copy; other times its's easier to just rent.  The white collar corporate iggs will pay for your chips and neck spikes. If you're lucky , the suits might even cover your sprays and juice. But when you work jobs like Audry does, it's more likely that you'll wind up becoming a modular human.

Covered head to toe in steal , syberware, and biotumors, Audry gazed deeply in the mirror. She has gone through this routine thousands of times--sometiems it's at 5am, sometimes 11pm, but it's always the same routine: She slams the alarm clock with her ComfortWear^tm shell that whe earned as a matress tester.  She then stumbles over to brew water for her Panama Plantation best instant coffee and McBeefBar^tm. From there, protien bar in hand, she selects her mudular attachments. She lucked out this time around. She's just a corporate temp. 

Unlike previous warehouses and factories, she was allowed to keep most of her body but still needed to install a central control system (CCS) and hypertextual auto-lenses (HTAL). The CCS wasn't too bad. She just had to plug an exoskeletal dorsal attachment for her hands into the antibacterial port next to her elbow. Most of it is plug n chug. But the painful part is interfacing it with the HTAL. She has to pop her bio-eye out of socket and unplug it from its receptor. Then she must pulug in the auto-lens and pop that into socket, remembering to put drops in every hour or two. Her HR compared it to putting in contacts.

Audry was thankful that dhoe didn't need leg implants and was able to ride her bike to work. Last warehous gig she had, she forgot and stomped through the pedal and the sidewalk.
