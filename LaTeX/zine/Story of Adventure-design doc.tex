\title{Story of Adventure: Design Doc}
\begin{document}
	
	\section{Goal}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Replicate the feeling of an anime-like series 
		\item  roll a handful of dice without slowing down the game 
		\item  tangible power levels 
		\item  tangible ends to "campaigns" to create a legacy of pantheons
		\item  "battles" have more to do with clever use of unique abilities (i.e. RP)
		\item  an ability (and, by extension, a character) creation system that can be generated and expanded upon
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Mechanics to be combined}
	
	\subsection{Uses for fudge dice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Chance: standard F roll
		\item  Competitive: xdF vs xdF
		\item  Challenge: x+ needed to pass
		\item  Cumulative challenge: x+ to be accumulated to pass. Bank all + result dice until the requirement is met
		\item  Fully commit: Reroll blanks
		\item  Advantage: bank 1+ for your next roll
		\item  Handicap: no negatives counted
		\item  Cooperative challenge: multiple people combine their rolls 
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{bonus for statistical anomaly}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Plot token to player upon any nat 4+
		\item  Plot token to GM upon any nat 4-
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Ways to count}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  As intended: +- is 0
		\item  Only one type counted: typically plus
		\item  Ignore one type: typically either - to handicap or \_ as unforgiving
		\item  Dual fates: No +- negation
		\item  Banking: set all dice with the same result off to the side, they may not be used until they are spent
	\end{itemize}
	\section{characters}
	\subsection{creation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Relevant profession/hobby (aka archetype)
		\item  Tools of the trade
		\item  ONLY 1 major
		\item  Up to 3 minor
		\item  Motivation
		\item  Why adventure?
		\item  Goals
		\item  1 major: sticks with you for a while
		\item  1-3 minor: path to acquire major
	\end{itemize}
	\section{how to compete/fight}
	\subsection{melee}
	\subsubsection{clash}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  xdF vs xdF
		\item  Whoever rolls higher has their full attack go through
		\item  If no one wins no damage is done
		\item  Invoke a dual fated 4dF roll to decide next turn advantage
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{dirty}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  xdF vs xdF-1
		\item  If you win, your full attack goes through
		\item  If you lose, there is no damage, you gain disadvantage for your next roll
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{ranged}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Roll xdF to aim
		\item  Roll XdF for destruction, even upon a miss
	\end{itemize}
	\section{ability creation}
	\subsection{conditions}
	Unique status effect types 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item honest positional (high, low, mid)(left, right, center) -1
		\item dishonest positional (point +1, flank -1, backstab -2), (above, below) -2
		\item time based activation (delayed, retroactive, over time) +2
		\item element based (rock paper scissors) +1
		\item Must target specific body part -1
		\item Disable +3
		\item range (cqc -1, standoff 0, far +2)
		\item combination (set-up, punchline, unique stacking) +1
		
		\item Roll 1 extra die
		\item Reroll all - once
		\item Reroll all - and \_ once
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{effect}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Meaty: level+ to roll
		\item  Supernatural advantage: unnatural 4+
		\item  Super assist: level+ to another's roll
	\end{itemize}
