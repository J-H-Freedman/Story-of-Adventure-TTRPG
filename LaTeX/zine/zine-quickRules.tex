	\subsection*{What are Fudge dice?}
	Fudge dice (dF) are six sided dice (d6) that have two sides with a plus, two sides with a minus, and two sides with a blank. A typical roll is 4dF where [+] and [-] cancel each other out. The result skews Neutral
	
	These dice are used to visually identify degrees of success and failure at a glance.
	
	\subsection*{Challenges and Overcoming Them}
		
	\section*{Advanced rules}
	Although the system is designed around degrees of success, the finesse of the Game Master rests in controlling tension. There are a couple different ways to perform a simple skill check:
	\begin{itemize}

		\item Empowered: [\_] count towards threshold. Ignore [-] results.
	\end{itemize}
