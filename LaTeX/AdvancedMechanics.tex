\chapter{Temporary Battle Damage}
The locations are specific and the impact of losing health temporarily limits a character's abilities.
\begin{itemize}
\item Head
\begin{itemize}
\item Always damage ESP.
\end{itemize}
\item Body
\begin{itemize}
\item Always damages END
\end{itemize}
\item Arms
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically damages POW
\item May also damage SPD
\end{itemize}
\item Legs
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically damages SPD
\item May also damage POW and/or END
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This battle damage may be recovered over time. This is the same way you woud normally recover health but it would go to specific parts of the body instead of to the normal health pool.

\chapter{Reactive Maximum Energy}
Recalculates at the \emph{beginning} of each turn. This way, plans
aren't disrupted mid-turn.
