\chapter{Modifications Archive}\label{ch:ref_enhance}
\emph{Modifcations} are developed from the various tech branches, and in additon to their varied effects each have their own rules for where they can be applied. 

\section{\dieselt\ Modifications}\label{sec:diesel_mods}
\emph{\dieselt\ Modifications} are lower-tech gas-powered augmentations that can be applied to the head, torso, arms, legs, or an existing modification. In situations where a modification is applied randomly the location is determined by the result of a d100 roll aginst the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
1-20 & Head \\
\hline
21 -40 & Torso \\
\hline
41 - 60 & Arms \\
\hline
61 - 80 & Legs \\
\hline
81 - 100 & Mod \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In situations where the modification is selected randomly it is selected by a 2 d100 results against the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
Location $\ddots$ Mod & 1 - 100 \\
\hline
1- 100 & Sample
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
(Editor's note) Just an idea. We'll figure this out (if we even want to do this) later once we have more mods to list obviously, but for now I thought this would be a painless way for selecting things randomly.

\section{\cybert\ Modifications}\label{sec:cybr_mods}
\emph{\cybert\ Modifications} are highly-sophistocated bio-robotics augmentations that can be applied to the head, torso, arms, legs, or an existing modification. In situations where a modification is applied randomly the location is determined by the result of a d100 roll aginst the following:

\section{\biot\ Modifications}\label{sec:bio_mods}
\emph{\biot\ Modifications} are high risk augmentations that utilize parasites to integrate themselves into the character's body at a molecular level. They can be applied to the head, torso, arms, legs, or their physiology. In situations where a modification is applied randomly the location is determined by the result of a d100 roll aginst the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
1-20 & Head \\
\hline

\section{\magit\ Modifications}\label{sec:magi_mods}
\emph{\magit\ Modifications} are ethereal, almost-otherworldly augmentations that can be applied to the head, torso, arms, legs, or the entire body. In situations where a modification is applied randomly the location is determined by the result of a d100 roll aginst the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
1-20 & Head \\

\chapter{Injuries Archive}\label{ch:ref_injure}
\emph{Injuries} are ailments that your character could encounter in their experiences, and can unfortunately take many forms. They could affect your character physically either externally or internally, or even the mind. Each form of injury will affect the results of or add a new condition to your challenges, and range in severity from \emph{minor} to \emph{mild} to \emph{major}. Some injuries can be cured, but many will become a permanent part of the character going forward. While most injuries can be felt by any character, there are also injuries specific to characters that have augmented themselves using the various tech branches.

\section{General}\label{sec:gen_injuries}
\emph{General} injuries are capable of impacting any character physiologically or psychologically.
\subsection{Minor}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsubsection*{Tinnitus}
Your character is distracted by a ringing in their ears (or equivalent auditory sensory organs). If a d100 roll in a \KNOWful\ challenge is above a 95, or 90 if the \emph{Sensitive Hearing} skill is applicable, then your character is completely distracted and fails the challenge outright.

\subsection{Major}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsubsection*{Defunct Shield}
The character's body has been weakened in a way that prevents them from using \ENful\ to shield themselves. All incoming damage is converted to \emph{direct damage}\footnoteref{subsec:damage_types}.

\section{\dieselt\ Injuries}\label{sec:dies_injuries}
\emph{\dieselt\ Injuries} are injuries that can affect a character that has taken \dieselt\ modifications. While as horrible as any injury, they are generally repairable with the right tools.

\section{\cybert\ Injuries}\label{sec:cybr_injuries}
\emph{\cybert\ Injuries} are injuries that can affect a character that has taken \cybert\ modifications. The complexities of \cybert\ makes repairing them difficult. Recovering from a \cybert\ injury will generally require a specialist with the right set of tools, or outright removal.

\section{\biot\ Injuries}\label{sec:bio_injuries}
\emph{\biot\ Injuries} are injuries that can affect a character that has taken \biot\ modifications. Due to the integrated nature of \biot , recovering from these injuries is near impossible and the altercations can be greatly inhibiting.
