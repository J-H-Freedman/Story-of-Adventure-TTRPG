POW
XdF dice rolled per each hit (separate rolls, not all at once)
positive (+) only
if all results are positive (+), then double the amount of damage delt. If the opposing END still produces a result below 0, then treat the result as if it is equal to 0.

#

END
XdF dice rolled against each POW roll
negative (-) only
if END brings the POW below 0, immediately end the attack phase and the attacker loses their next action (this carries over between turns)

#

SPD
XdF dice rolled to produce hits
positive (+) only
if all results are positive (+), then double the amount of hits delt. If the opposing ESP still produces a result below 0, then treat the result as if it is equal to 0.

#

ESP
XdF rolled against SPD to reduce hits
negative (-) only
if ESP brings the SPD below 0, immediately end the attack phase and the ESPer immediately performs an action for free
