Story of Adventure - Writing Branch README & FAQ - v1.0

+==================| Where is the manual? Character sheets? |=======================+

Not here! If you're looking for those they are in the master branch in the "pdf"
folder.

+===========================| So what is this then? |===============================+

This is the writing branch. This branch is dedicated to cataloging, rough or 
otherwise, the copy for the manual as well as short stories or other bits of writing
that contribute to developing the game world itself.

Story of Adventure - Game-Design Branch README & FAQ - v1.0

+==================| Where is the manual? Character sheets? |=======================+

Not here! If you're looking for those they can be found in the "pdf" folder of the 
master branch, or the nightly branch if you're feeling experimental.

+===========================| So what is this then? |===============================+

This is the game-design branch. Instead of a "branch" in the traditional sense this is
more of a "mini-repository" for aggregating all of our game-mechanics related ideas 
that could eventually make their way into the game proper. Feel free to browse and
make suggestions, but if you're looking for any of the actual game materials then 
you'll need to look elsewhere.

+=============| I've got ideas and I'd like to help! What do I need? |==============+

Your favorite document processor. For ease-of-transfer we recommend using plain-text
file types (e.g. txt), but any type is fine as long as it can be easily managed in a
standard document processor like libreoffice (i.e. don't submit formats like pdf,
 powerpoint, png, etc.).

+========================| So I merge this to master? |=============================+

Absolutely not. The copy, stories, and any other bits will be "merged" by being added 
into the manual as it is updated.  Functionally speaking, this is a seperate 
"mini-repository" that, while related, is being developed in parallel to the master 
branch instead of being a direct offshoot from it like branches normally are. This 
should not be directly merged to master under any circumstances, because the files 
here do not reflect anything located in the master branch.
