Story of Adventure - Writing Branch README & FAQ - v1.0

+==================| Where is the manual? Character sheets? |=======================+
Not here! If you're looking for those they are in the master branch in the "pdf"
folder.

+===========================| So what is this then? |===============================+
This is the writing branch. This branch is dedicated to cataloging, rough or 
otherwise, the copy for the manual as well as short stories or other bits of writing
that contribute to developing the game world itself.

+=============| I've got ideas and I'd like to help! What do I need? |==============+
Your favorite document processor. For ease-of-transfer we recommend using plain-text
file types (e.g. txt), but any type is fine as long as it can be easily managed in a
standard document processor like libreoffice (i.e. don't submit formats like pdf,
 powerpoint, png, etc.).
