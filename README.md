Story of Adventure - Writing Branch README & FAQ - v1.0

+==================| Where is the manual? Character sheets? |=======================+
Not here! If you're looking for those they are in the master branch in the "pdf"
folder.

+===========================| So what is this then? |===============================+
This is the writing branch. This branch is dedicated to cataloging, rough or 
otherwise, the copy for the manual as well as short stories or other bits of writing
that contribute to developing the game world itself.

+=============| I've got ideas and I'd like to help! What do I need? |==============+
Your favorite document processor. For ease-of-transfer we recommend using plain-text
file types (e.g. txt), but any type is fine as long as it can be easily managed in a
standard document processor like libreoffice (i.e. don't submit formats like pdf,
 powerpoint, png, etc.).

+========================| So I merge this to master? |=============================+
Absolutely not. The copy, stories, and any other bits will be "merged" by being added 
into the manual as it is updated.  Functionally speaking, this is a seperate 
"mini-repository" that, while related, is being developed in parallel to the master 
branch instead of being a direct offshoot from it like branches normally are. This 
should not be directly merged to master under any circumstances, because the files 
here do not reflect anything located in the master branch.
