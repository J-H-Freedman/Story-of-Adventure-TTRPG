Viewing the documents -------------------------------
The latest copies of the documents can be found in the "pdf" folder. They should be viewable in most pdf viewers and browsers.


Editing the document --------------------------------

To edit the document itself, you will need a standard install of LaTeX, Make, and the IDE or Text Editor of your choice. 
For LaTeX we recommend using either TeXLive (http://tug.org/texlive/) or MikTex (https://miktex.org/). These are standard and should contain everything LaTeX you will need. 
For anything else be sure that it supports the following packages:
newcent, helvet, courier, fontenc, inputenc, geometry, amssymb, imakeidx, titling, float, ragged2e, hyperref

And also contains a copy of pdflatex. 

For compiling simply navigate to the LaTeX folder and run make. Current options are as follows:
*nothing* : Compiles the document and places the pdf in the "pdf" folder. 
clean : removes any ancillary files generated by pdflatex (e.g. aux, out, log).
