Story of Adventure - Doc-Design Branch README & FAQ - v1.0

+==================| Where is the manual? Character sheets? |=======================+

Not here! If you're looking for those they can be found in the "pdf" folder of the 
master branch, or the nightly branch if you're feeling experimental.

+===========================| So what is this then? |===============================+

This is the doc-design branch. Instead of a "branch" in the traditional sense this is
more of a "mini-repository" for aggregating all of our document-design-related ideas 
that could eventually make their way into the game manual. Feel free to browse and 
make suggestions, but if you're looking for any of the actual game materials then 
you'll need to look elsewhere.  

+=============| I've got ideas and I'd like to help! What do I need? |==============+

A ".tex" file along with the resulting pdf would be ideal, but is not a requirement. 
Otherwise designer file types are recommended (e.g. kra, psd, gimp), but any image 
format is fine so long as it is portable (e.g. pdf, png). 

+========================| So I merge this to master? |=============================+

Absolutely not. The files, discussions, and whatever-else-is-going-here will be 
"merged" by being added into the manual as it is updated.  Functionally speaking, 
this is a seperate "mini-repository" that, while related, is being developed in 
parallel to the master branch instead of being a direct offshoot from it like 
branches normally are. This should not be directly merged to master under any 
circumstances, because the files here do not reflect anything located in the master 
branch.
