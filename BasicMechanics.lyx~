\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passing challenges are the core to every game, let alone role playing games.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In SoA, you will almost always want aquire numbers as high as possible to
 pass these challenges.
 You will have plenty tools to help you in this goal: dice rolls, attribute
 effects & modifiers, and skills/techniques.

 This comes after possible rolls, modifiers, and other variables.

 or negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the Challenges you will encounter require only one success to pass.
 However some challenges will require multiple successes or will result
 in a binary succeed/fail instead of counting the degree.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Degree
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases that do not result in a tie (i.e.
 most of them) you will succeed or fail by an amount refered to as its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

degree.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $highTotal-lowTotal=degree$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Degrees can be used intuitively to interpret specific results from a binary
 pass/fail state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Degrees can also be used as a variable to be used in further calculations
 (i.e.
 damage

\end_layout

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
These are the most common kinds in TTRPGs.
 They are non-combat related and can range from climbing a fence to painting
 a fence to breaking a fence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are 
\emph on

 and are tied to your Attributes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Attributes, x.x.x
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These typically involve you rolling over a determined threashold decided
 by the GM.
 They may be treated as either a pass/fail binary or be treated with degrees
 of success or failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Determined Threshold
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Determined Threshold
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the GM requests that you complete an Obsticle Challenge, they usually
 have a number in mind that must be met or surpassed.
 This is the 
\emph on
Determined Threshold
\emph default
.
 The higher the number, the more difficult the challenge is.
 Other variations can include a Determined Threshold of Successes
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Determined Threshold!of Successes
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in which you must succeed a number of times to pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM may or may not tell you what exactly this threshold is.
 Sharing this information may create tangable tension but hiding it should
 be flat out scary.

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
degrees
\emph default
, x.x.x
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of success/failure of the given challenge.
 The damage will then be distributed to health and/or energy.
 There are some contexts in which damage will go directly to health, but
 I recommend those to be few and far between.

\begin_layout Section
Cool tokens

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Cool tokens
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cool tokens are a special mechanic to encourage sub-optimal play for the
 sake of gauranteeing successes later.
 This is to create creative play that puts the player at an explicit disadvantag
e.
 It is given by the GM when he feels like it will make the story better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may build character; it may be narratively interesting; it may be a character
 flaw; it may be a failed roll during high tension; etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is subjective, this does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 excuse stupidity.
 
\emph on
Never
\emph default
 assume the GM will give you cool tokens.
 Roleplay appropriately and see what happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spending a cool token must be done and announced 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 you roll for your challenge.
 This is so the GM can hand you a 
\emph on
second
\emph default
 d100.
 For the result of your challenge; you may choose to use either of the dice
 or both
\begin_inset Marginal
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Usually you will chose to use both, but there are contexts in which you
 will prefer only one number (i.e.
 ESP)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended for the maximum Cool token cap to be 1 per player, but
 this suggested may be bent at the GM's discression

\begin_layout Standard
Health represents tangable, lasting damage to a character's body.
 Although most damage can get absorbed by energy, the GM may utilize Direct

Death
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a character's health reaches or drops below 0, the character is dead.
 The good news is that death doesn't have to be perminent! This may be an
 opportunity for your friends to go on an adventure to revive you while
 you train in the afterlife and learn a new technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if the player desires, they may instead create a new character
 to be recruited by the adventuring party.
 Just know that it is a 
\emph on
choice
\emph default
 and not a neccessity.

 of health.
 The damage may be split at the defender's disgression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Exersion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a character's energy drops to 0, the character is exerting themself.
 All instances that would normally go to energy instead go to health.
 You may choose to pass out at any time when exerting yourself.
 If there are no challenges you are currently participating in; or if there

Passing Out

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you pass out, you may not act in any way until rested or healed.
 It is univerally frowned upon to attack a passed out opponent and only
 the most evil character would spitefully do such an act.
